    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I've always loved programming. I'm glad that through all the knowledge and skills I gained thoughout my years at Sac State, I can finally develop products that everyone can use.</p>
    <p>I also love playing volleyball and soccer whenever I'm not working on a side project</p>
